# python_lift_adapter

This project is made to complement RMF compliant lifts through the use of optical information tranmission in the form of QR codes. The original code can be found here: [zeroEighteen/RMF_Compliant_Lift](https://github.com/zeroEighteen/RMF_Compliant_Lift)

Made with ❤️ by Elliot and John

## Acknowledgments
This project was made by John Ong and Elliot Koh during their Dec 2023 Internship at the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA). It would not have been possible without our mentors', Ang Chai Yit and Hee Yong Siong, patience and support throughout the entire project. 

Thank you to the previous interns for providing the base code for us to build upon, and the other interns for their moral support through our work
